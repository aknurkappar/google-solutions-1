IMPORTING
---------
Step-by-step instructions for importing the **BeJomart** project.

#### 1. Download ZIP and unpacking
Download our ZIP archive and unpack it to the folder you want.

#### 2. The path in the command prompt
Specify the path to the folder where you unpacked the ZIP archive in the command prompt.

#### 3. Installing libraries and modules
Since the ZIP archive goes without the necessary libraries and modules, you will need to install them.

To do this, you need to enter the following command:

      npm install
      
#### 4. Project start

      ng serve --open

Please make sure the release file is unpacked under a Web-accessible
directory. You shall see the following files and directories:

      demos/               demos
